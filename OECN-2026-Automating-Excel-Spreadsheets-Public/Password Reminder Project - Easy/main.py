#How to activate virtual envirnonment in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) terminal:
#1. Open Powershell Terminal
#2. Navigate to the directory where your virtual environment is located using the `cd` command.
#3. Activate the virtual environment:
#   - cd into the OECN-2026-Automating-Excel-Spreadsheets directory where the virtual environment is located and enter: .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
#   - if there is an execution policy error, run the following in the powershell terminal: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
#   - then try activating the virtual environment again: .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

#How to install libraries into the virtual environment:
    # - cd into OECN-2026-Automating-Excel-Spreadsheets and enter .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install moduleName
    # - Note replace moduleName with the name of the library you want to install, for example: .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install openpyxl


#How to run scripts in the virtual environment:
    # - cd into OECN-2026-Automating-Excel-Spreadsheets/Password Reminder Project - Easy and enter python main.py
    #(.venv) PS C:\Users\Jon\source\repos\OECN 2026 Demos\OECN-2026-Automating-Excel-Spreadsheets\Password Reminder Project - Easy> python main.py
